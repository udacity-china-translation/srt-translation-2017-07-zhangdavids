1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,710
There are at least as many ways to set up

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,075
a programming environment as there are programmers,

3
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:06,740
and there's no right or wrong way to go about it.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,599
However, if you're just starting out in writing

5
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,035
Python you might like to see my screen to get some ideas.

6
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:14,114
Time for a tour of my screen.

7
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,219
Over here, I have my text editor.

8
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,035
I'm using sublime text which is great for getting started,

9
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:22,428
but my fellow Udacians recommended a notepad++,

10
00:00:22,428 --> 00:00:25,464
atom, vim and many others.

11
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:29,740
A text editor is really different from a word processor, so don't mix them up.

12
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,834
Code needs to be written line by line,

13
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:34,625
with line breaks and indentations included on purpose.

14
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:38,179
In ways that fundamentally change how the code is read and run.

15
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,409
Good text editors have

16
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:43,579
simple but vital features such as syntax highlighting and line numbers.

17
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,945
Editors are highly customizable to suit your style.

18
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:49,070
One setting that I use on coding in Python

19
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,740
is the setting that converts tabs into four spaces.

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,800
Indentation levels in Python are always multiples of

21
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,608
four spaces and I don't want to be making mistakes as I hit the spacebar.

22
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:01,024
The tabs shortcut really helps.

23
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:04,224
The text editor isn't the only thing on my screen right now.

24
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:09,609
The terminal window is here so that I can run my script.

25
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:12,504
Generally, I can't write a whole lot of code in one go

26
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:16,224
because something will go wrong and I'll need to find the issue and debug it.

27
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:18,564
When there is an error it will show up here,

28
00:01:18,564 --> 00:01:20,560
in the terminal for me to read.

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,975
I make small changes to the code in the text editor,

30
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:25,359
then run the script to see the output.

31
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:31,230
If I see a problem I'll try to fix it or if things seem to be working, I'll move on.

32
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,340
I've also got the Udacity classroom and some documentation open in my browser.

33
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,570
Normally, I'll need a browser open to look up

34
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:41,419
documentation or to search for the solution to a bug I encounter along the way.
